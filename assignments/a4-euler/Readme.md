Above, we can see a grid of rotating teapots. We rotate the teapots by adjusting the Euler angles of rotation. We can choose an order of rotation, and the orientation of teapots becomes different when we change the order of rotation at a specific point in time.


2. Unique (rotating spiral)

Above, we can see a spiral moving in a circle and changing its color based on its position. It also rotates around x, y and z axes. The rotation around those axes is controlled by keyboard input.
