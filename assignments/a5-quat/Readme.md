On the video above, one can observe that quaternion rotations are synchronous with Euler angle rotations. We can choose an order of rotation, and the orientation of teapots becomes different when we change the order of rotation at a specific point in time.

2. Unique - Cuboids rotating towards the target

On the video above, one can see cuboids drawn next to each other forming rows of lines. The cuboids rotate around their positions towards the position of the mouse. Only the cuboids that are located within 100 units from the mouse target rotate, the other cuboids stay in their original positions. Colors of cuboid rows are interpolated based on position.
