From the above gif, we can see that the output for the control points and interpolation values of linear splines is as expected.

2. Catmull - Rom splines

From the above gif, we can see that the output for the control points and interpolation values of Catmull - Rom splines is as expected.

3. Hermite splines

From the above gif, we can see that the output for the control points and interpolation values of Hermite splines is as expected.

4. Spline

From the above gif, we can see that the output for the spline interpolation values is as expected.

5. Curve editor

The above gif draws linear, catmull-rom and hermite splines, gives an option to see the control points and edit the curve using control points. It also shows both clamped and natural versions of hermite spline.


6. Unique (glittery star)

The above gif shows a glittery star drawn using linear, Catmull-Rom and Hermite splines. The color of the star is interpolated using a Catmull-Rom spline giving a glitter effect.
