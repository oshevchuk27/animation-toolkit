1. Blend

We can see that the walk motion is blended correctly with the strafe motion. The blended motion tends towards one motion or another as we increase and decrease alpha.

2. Splice

We can see a spliced motion where the upper part of the body of the character performs one motion and the lower part another one. As alpha increases, the motion of the upper part becomes closer to the motion of the lower part.

3. Zombie arms

When pressing 0, we can see the original motion of the character, when pressing 1, we can see the motion of the character with arms frozen in constant position, when pressing 2, we can see the character move its arms as it walks.

4. Reorient

We can see that the character is placed at a new position and orientation each time some key is pressed.

5. Unique. 

A character drinking soda and jumping jacks, jogging, doing squats, side twists and stretches at the same time (the upper body motion is drinking soda and the lower body motion is the rest). It also has flower balloons above which move together with character joints.
